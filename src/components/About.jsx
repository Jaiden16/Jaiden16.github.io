            <p>I am Programmer who has a passion for Video Games and Webdesign. I have participated
            in a couple Hack-a-thon's (gaming related) and a recent Hack-a-thon for webdesign for fashion week NYC. A few of my favorite moments in my 
            programming path were the times I've participated in the Microsoft Playcrafting, and Game-A-Con in Alantic City, New Jersey one year.</p>
